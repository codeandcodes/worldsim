# fix
Right now after two agents group up, they don't move afterwards. We need to make some modifications - 
there should be a leader which determines the actions of the group. 
The group's actions should be represented by a new prompt to the LLM acting as leader for the group. 
They can do similar activities to agents of course, but should be more motivated to find other agents, 
team up with others, or attack other smaller groups or individual agents who are unwilling to group. 
Movement should happen in close packs (groups move together), unless the leader determines an individual agent should go explore.

# in perception if someone is occupying the spot, you cannot move there, but you can either group or attack the occupier.
